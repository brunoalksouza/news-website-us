          THE COMPLAINT CAME AFTER PASSENGERS SUSPECTED HE WAS ARMED DURING THE
          FLIGHT... BUT IN FACT HE HAD AN ERECTION! <br />In the interview with
          our report, the owner of onlyfans revealed that on his trip to india,
          he did a <span class="highlight">“bull trick”</span>, a 15-second
          trick to recover his erections that he had lost due to his addiction
          to pornography...
        </p>
        <p>
          He said that he got so excited that he overdid it and ended up having
          <strong>an erection for more than 14 hours</strong>, leaving the women
          on the flight SCARED and suspecting that he was armed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has already been released by the police and, by way of an apology,
          <strong

            trick</strong
